# This file contains the order and numbering for all sections in the book.
#
# It is a sample TOC file to help you get started. Fill it out with entries
# for your own content.
#
# Each entry has the following schema:
#
# - title: mytitle   # Title of chapter or section
#   url: /myurl  # URL of section relative to the /content/ folder.
#   sections:  # Contains a list of more entries that make up the chapter's sections
#   not_numbered: true  # if the section shouldn't have a number in the sidebar
#     (e.g. Introduction or appendices)
#   expand_sections: true  # if you'd like the sections of this chapter to always
#     be expanded in the sidebar.
#   external: true  # Whether the URL is an external link or points to content in the book
#   no_link: true  # If true, only text is rendered instead of a link. Used for in-progress sections.
#
# Below are some special values that trigger specific behavior:
# - search: true  # Will provide a link to a search page
# - divider: true  # Will insert a divider in the sidebar
# - header: My Header  # Will insert a header with no link in the sidebar
#
# See the links below for an example.

# Top-level page
- title: Introduction
  url: /intro
  not_numbered: true
  external: false
  # Hard-coded redirects used to avoid breaking links when modifying the book.
  # Each redirect needs a `from` and `to` key. Redirects can technically get
  # placed in any chapter but we'll keep them all here for simplicity.
  #redirects:
    #- from: ch/05/eda_intro
    #  to: ch/04/eda_intro
    #- from: ch/04/cleaning_intro
    #  to: ch/05/cleaning_intro
