<h2 id="Functions">Functions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Functions"> </a></h2><p>A <strong>function</strong> is a sequence of statements that has been given a name. Functions usually (but not always) take some number of inputs, called <strong>parameters</strong>, and usually (but not always) give an output, called the <strong>return value</strong>. When we use a function in our code, we say that we are <strong>calling</strong> the function.</p>
<p>Python has many built-in functions, such as <code>print()</code>, <code>sum()</code>, <code>len()</code>, and <code>int()</code>. In this chapter, we will discuss how to create our own user-defined functions.</p>

<h2 id="Modularity">Modularity<a class="anchor-link" href="#Modularity"> </a></h2><p>User-defined functions are useful when you find yourself needing to repeat a task that requires many lines of code, with little-to-change in code between different implementations of the task. In this situation, it might be helpful to group together these lines of code into a function. You can then simply call the function whenever you need to use it, potentially reducing several lines of code into a single code. Taking advantage of the modularity provided by functions can make your code easier to write, easier to read, and easier to debug.</p>
