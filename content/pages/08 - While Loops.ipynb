    "A `while` loop is similar to a `for` loop in that it is a tool used to automate a repetive task. The core difference between `while` and `for` loops is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `for` loop executes a predetermined number of times. A `for` loop that begins with **`\"for i in range(a,b)\"`** will execute exactly once for each value of the counter `i` that falls within the given range. \n",
    "* A `while` loop executes as long as some supplied condition is true. Depending on the nature of this condition, we do not necessarily know ahead of time how many times the loop will execute. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a basic level, `for` loops and `while` loops behave similarly, as shown by the following examples."
