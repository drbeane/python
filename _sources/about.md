Python Programming
============================

Welcome to Python Programming! The primary goal of this web-book is to provide an introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general. This book is also meant to serve as a reference for anyone who programs in Python.

```{admonition} Note
:class: warning
This book is a work in progress and you are viewing it as it is being constructed. Many pages are incomplete and much of the content and structure will change in the near future.
```

The contents of this book are arranged into the following seven sections:
* **Getting Started.** This section provides mostly non-technical introductions to programming and to the Python programming language. It also provides instructions for setting your environment.
* **Python Basics.** This section provides resources for writing simple Python expressions, for performing arithmetic calculations, and for working with variables.
* **Basic Data Types.** Here you will learn about some of the basic Python data types. These data types represent simple types of information such as numbers and text.
* **Collections.** This section will introduce you to collection objects which can be used to store multiple pieces of information.  
* **Control Flow.** Here you will find information related to repetition and branching.
* **Functions and Classes.** The concepts introduced in this section will allow for modularity and reusability of your code.
* **Additional Topics.** This section contains an assortment of topics, including references for many useful Python packages.

## Other Resources

This web-book is part of a planned series of four web-books dealing with Python. Information about the books in this series can be found below. Please note that all of these books are currently under development.
